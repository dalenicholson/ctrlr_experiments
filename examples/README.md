### **Roland D50 examples**

*   **`PKGBUILD-sample.txt`:** This is an example of *how to distribute* a finished panel to the Linux/Arch user community. It automates the download and installation process. The key takeaway is that the final product is a single `.bpanelz` file hosted somewhere, and the standard installation path is `/usr/share/ctrlr/panels/`. The `replaces` field also indicates this is an update to an older package, a good practice for maintenance.
*   **`D-50.jpg`:** This is the high-quality background image asset created during **Phase 1.4**. Its author, Anders Eriksson, clearly did extensive research on the D-50's architecture to group the controls so logically. This is the "skin" of the panel. All the sliders and buttons are Ctrlr components placed on top of this image.
